# IMDB query

IMdb hosts a lot of information about movies. Using easy to use python APIs, you can query information about a list of movies you have and visualise the results of the most popular ones and later to make you life easier. You can simply go to the website and do your analysis. But if you are into the field of movie making, marketing or sales, programmatic approaches will give you a comprehensive idea of whats happening, and you'll need programmers and data scientists to help in getting and analyzing the data in bulk.
